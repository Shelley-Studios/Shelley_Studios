        <p>The town of Rainbow Valley is home to several animal-like creatures that make up the core cast of <i>Tales From the Valley</i>. You can learn more about them here!</p>
        <h2>Dean</h2>
        <p>Dean is a kind-hearted and gentle bison. He loves to spend time with the other residents. He is especially attached to West, who he cares for like a son. Dean also likes to write. He keeps a journal, which he writes in every day. In the mornings, he works at the Rainbow Valley General Store.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Joan</h2>
        <p>Joan is a wise and intelligent bear. She enjoys drinking tea in the afternoons and reading a good book. She loves to work at the library and encourage the other residents to read.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Butch</h2>

        <br>
        <h2>Marvin</h2>

        <br>
